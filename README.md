> A powerful VS Code extension for managing and enforcing project-specific rules and conventions.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìù **Rule Management** - Create, edit and organize project rules in markdown
- ü§ñ **AI Integration** - Generate rules and improvements with AI assistance
- üîÑ **Synchronization** - Keep team rules in sync with server-based sharing
- üìä **Task Management** - Create and track implementation tasks for rules
- üß† **MCP Protocol** - Advanced AI model context protocol management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code v1.80.0 or later
- Node.js (for development)

### Installation

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
3. Search for "Project Rules".
4. Click "Install".

Alternatively, install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reconsumeralization.project-rules-extension).

### First Steps

1. Open the Project Rules view from the activity bar (usually a clipboard icon).
2. Create your first rule using the command palette: `Project Rules: Create New Rule`.
3. Explore AI-powered features: `Project Rules: Suggest Rule Improvements`.

## üìù Rule Management

Create custom rules in `.mdc` files that define coding standards, architectural guidelines, and project conventions:

- **Create rules** with easy-to-use templates
- **Edit rules** directly in VS Code
- **Organize rules** into categories
- **Generate rules** automatically from existing code files
- **Preview rules** with rendered markdown before saving
- **`.mdc` Format**: A markdown-based format allowing for metadata (like ID, category, severity) and rule content separation using front matter. Example:

  ```markdown
  ---
  id: PR001
  category: Formatting
  severity: Warning
  ---
  # Rule Title

  Rule description using standard markdown...
  ```

## ü§ñ AI Integration

Leverage AI to improve your project guidelines:

- **Auto-generate rules** from existing code patterns
- **Get improvement suggestions** for existing rules
- **Autonomous monitoring** for rule violations and improvement opportunities
- **Fine-tune AI context** with configurable settings
- **Preview AI suggestions** before applying them using `projectRules.previewSuggestion`
- **Approve or dismiss** suggestions with `projectRules.approveSuggestedRule` and `projectRules.dismissSuggestedRule`

### How it Works

The AI integration analyzes your code (respecting `.gitignore` and configuration settings) and existing rules to:

- Identify patterns and suggest new rules.
- Compare rule descriptions with code style and suggest improvements.
- Generate implementation tasks based on rule requirements.
- Summarize large files or multiple files to fit context limits (configurable).

*Note: An API key for the AI service is required (`projectRules.ai.apiKey`).*

## üîÑ Rule Synchronization

Keep your team's rules consistent:

- **Server synchronization** for team-wide rule sharing
- **Background sync** at configurable intervals
- **Conflict resolution** with visual diff views
- **Fetch latest changes** without full synchronization
- **Offline support** with local-first operations

## üìä Task Management

Implement rules with trackable tasks:

- **Create tasks** manually or with AI assistance
- **Generate implementation tasks** from rules
- **Estimate complexity** of implementation work using `projectRules.estimateTaskComplexity`
- **Assign ownership** to team members
- **Track progress** of rule implementation
- **View tasks** globally or filtered by rule (`projectRules.showTasksForRule`)

## üß† MCP Protocol Integration

Advanced AI model context management:

- **MCP Editor** for creating standardized AI context protocols
- **Agent Management** for monitoring AI assistants
- **Protocol Validation** to ensure consistency
- **Agent Statistics** for tracking performance
- **Autonomy Controls** for AI-driven suggestions

## üîß Architecture

The extension follows a standard VS Code architecture:

1. **Extension Host (Node.js)**: Runs the core logic, file system access, and interacts with the VS Code API.
2. **Webview (Browser)**: Renders the UI components (Rule Explorer, Task View, MCP Editor) using web technologies (React, Tailwind assumed).
3. **Message Passing**: A secure bridge for communication between the Extension Host and Webview environments.

*(Placeholder: Add link to a diagram or more detailed architecture doc if available)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

To contribute or run the extension locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/reconsumeralization/project-rules-extension.git
    cd project-rules-extension
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3. **Build the extension:**

    ```bash
    npm run compile
    # or yarn compile (or specific build script)
    ```

4. **Open in VS Code:**

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

5. **Run the extension:** Press `F5` to open a new Extension Development Host window with the extension loaded.

### Webpack Configuration

This extension uses webpack for bundling both the Node.js extension code and browser-based webview UI components. See [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js) for the configuration details.

### Debugging

- Use the VS Code debugger (`F5`) to debug the Extension Host code.
- To debug Webview UI components, open the Extension Development Host window, run `Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools` from the command palette, and use the browser's developer tools.

### Testing

*(Placeholder: Describe the testing strategy - unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests. Mention commands like `npm test` or `yarn test`)*
