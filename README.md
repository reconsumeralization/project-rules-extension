> A powerful VS Code extension for managing and enforcing project-specific rules and conventions.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìù **Rule Management** - Create, edit and organize project rules in markdown
- ü§ñ **AI Integration** - Generate rules and improvements with AI assistance
- üîÑ **Synchronization** - Keep team rules in sync with server-based sharing
- üìä **Task Management** - Create and track implementation tasks for rules
- üß† **MCP Protocol** - Advanced AI model context protocol management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code v1.80.0 or later
- Node.js (for development)

### Installation

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
3. Search for "Project Rules".
4. Click "Install".

Alternatively, install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reconsumeralization.project-rules-extension).

### First Steps

1. Open the Project Rules view from the activity bar (usually a clipboard icon).
2. Create your first rule using the command palette: `Project Rules: Create New Rule`.
3. Explore AI-powered features: `Project Rules: Suggest Rule Improvements`.

## üìù Rule Management

Create custom rules in `.mdc` files that define coding standards, architectural guidelines, and project conventions:

- **Create rules** with easy-to-use templates
- **Edit rules** directly in VS Code
- **Organize rules** into categories
- **Generate rules** automatically from existing code files
- **Preview rules** with rendered markdown before saving
- **`.mdc` Format**: A markdown-based format allowing for metadata (like ID, category, severity) and rule content separation using front matter. Example:

  ```markdown
  ---
  id: PR001
  category: Formatting
  severity: Warning
  ---
  # Rule Title

  Rule description using standard markdown...
  ```

## ü§ñ AI Integration

Leverage AI to improve your project guidelines:

- **Auto-generate rules** from existing code patterns
- **Get improvement suggestions** for existing rules
- **Autonomous monitoring** for rule violations and improvement opportunities
- **Fine-tune AI context** with configurable settings
- **Preview AI suggestions** before applying them using `projectRules.previewSuggestion`
- **Approve or dismiss** suggestions with `projectRules.approveSuggestedRule` and `projectRules.dismissSuggestedRule`

### How it Works

The AI integration analyzes your code (respecting `.gitignore` and configuration settings) and existing rules to:

- Identify patterns and suggest new rules.
- Compare rule descriptions with code style and suggest improvements.
- Generate implementation tasks based on rule requirements.
- Summarize large files or multiple files to fit context limits (configurable).

### Note: An API key for the AI service is required (`projectRules.ai.apiKey`)

## üîÑ Rule Synchronization

Keep your team's rules consistent:

- **Server synchronization** for team-wide rule sharing
- **Background sync** at configurable intervals
- **Conflict resolution** with visual diff views
- **Fetch latest changes** without full synchronization
- **Offline support** with local-first operations

## üìä Task Management

Project Rules Extension includes a task management system called Taskmaster that helps you track implementation tasks. You can:

- View and manage tasks from within VS Code
- Break down tasks into subtasks
- Link tasks to rules
- Track dependencies between tasks
- Use AI to estimate task complexity

### Taskmaster Storage System

Taskmaster now includes a real storage system that replaces the simulated commands in the original implementation. This system provides:

- File-based JSON storage for tasks
- Task action logging
- Parent-child task relationships
- Phase-based organization
- Command-line interface

To get started with the real taskmaster implementation:

```bash
# Initialize with sample tasks
npm run taskmaster:init

# View tasks in the dashboard
npm run taskmaster:dashboard

# Work on specific task
npm run taskmaster -- --task=<task-id>

# Use the CLI tool directly
npm run taskmaster:cli list
```

For detailed documentation on the storage system, see [docs/taskmaster/taskmaster-storage.md](docs/taskmaster/taskmaster-storage.md).

## üß† MCP Protocol Integration

Advanced AI model context management:

- **MCP Editor** for creating standardized AI context protocols
  - Design structured context protocols with dedicated editor
  - Define parameters, capabilities, and limitations for AI models
  - Use markdown-based format with specialized validation
  - Create templates for different types of AI interactions
  - Version and track changes to protocols over time

- **Agent Management** for monitoring AI assistants
  - Register and configure AI agents with the MCP server
  - Control agent activation state (active/inactive/paused)
  - Define agent roles and permissions within your project
  - Manage agent interactions with rules and tasks
  - View agent execution logs and action history

- **Protocol Validation** to ensure consistency
  - Automatic validation against MCP schema
  - Detect missing or inconsistent parameters
  - Ensure proper formatting and structure
  - Generate warnings for potential issues
  - Suggestions for improving protocol effectiveness

- **Agent Statistics** for tracking performance
  - Monitor processing time and resource usage
  - Track suggestion quality and acceptance rate
  - Measure agent productivity and contribution
  - Compare performance across different agents
  - Export metrics for external analysis

- **Autonomy Controls** for AI-driven suggestions
  - Set autonomy levels from manual-only to fully autonomous
  - Schedule automated analysis cycles
  - Configure suggestion thresholds and confidence levels
  - Define scope boundaries for autonomous operation
  - Emergency override controls for unexpected behavior

## üîß Architecture

The extension follows a standard VS Code architecture:

1. **Extension Host (Node.js)**: Runs the core logic, file system access, and interacts with the VS Code API.
2. **Webview (Browser)**: Renders the UI components (Rule Explorer, Task View, MCP Editor) using web technologies (React, Tailwind assumed).
3. **Message Passing**: A secure bridge for communication between the Extension Host and Webview environments.

## Taskmaster Integration

This project uses Taskmaster for managing task implementation workflow. The workflow is automated via both JavaScript and shell scripts.

### Taskmaster Workflow Guidelines

1. Always check the current task status using `taskmaster list` before starting work.
2. When starting a task, use `taskmaster update id=[task_id] status=in-progress` to update its status.
3. After completing a task, use `taskmaster update id=[task_id] status=completed` to mark it as done.
4. Use `taskmaster next` to identify the next task to work on based on dependencies.
5. Document architectural decisions in task notes files (in `docs/taskmaster`).

### Automation Options

You can run the Taskmaster workflow in various modes:

#### NPM Scripts

- `npm run taskmaster` - Interactive workflow (ask questions)
- `npm run taskmaster:auto` - Fully automated mode with default choices
- `npm run taskmaster:complete` - Automatically complete the current task
- `npm run taskmaster:task 123` - Work on a specific task ID

#### VS Code Tasks

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "Tasks: Run Task" to access:

- `Taskmaster: Start Next Task` - Interactive workflow
- `Taskmaster: Auto-Start Next Task` - Fully automated
- `Taskmaster: Complete Current Task` - Mark current as done
- `Taskmaster: Work on Specific Task` - Specify task ID

#### GitHub Actions

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/taskmaster.yml` that can be triggered manually to:

- Check current tasks
- Start the next available task
- Complete the current task
- Work on a specific task
