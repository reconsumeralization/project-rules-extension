## Selected Approach

**Adapter Pattern**

Create adapter functions to convert between different event types

### Implementation Notes

- Complexity: 3/5
- Risk: 2/5
- Time Estimate: 8 hours

## Decision Rationale

lower complexity

## Approaches Considered

### 1. Direct Type Casting

Cast event types directly between React and VSCode events

**Pros:**

- Simple implementation with minimal code
- Quick to implement
- Low learning curve for the team

**Cons:**

- Reduced type safety
- May miss edge cases in different event structures
- Harder to maintain as component APIs evolve

**Metrics:**

- Complexity: 1/5
- Risk: 4/5
- Time Estimate: 4 hours

### 2. Adapter Pattern

Create adapter functions to convert between different event types

**Pros:**

- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable as component interfaces change
- Improves code organization

**Cons:**

- More code to write and maintain
- Requires consistent usage across codebase
- Additional abstraction layer

**Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5
- Risk: 2/5
- Time Estimate: 8 hours

### 3. Event Normalization

Create a normalized event interface that works with both systems

**Pros:**

- Most flexible solution for future changes
- Best type safety and consistency
- Centralizes event handling logic

**Cons:**

- Most complex implementation
- Higher upfront development cost
- May introduce performance overhead

**Metrics:**

- Complexity: 4/5
- Risk: 3/5
- Time Estimate: 12 hours
