# Taskmaster Tradeoff Analysis Guide

This document explains how to use the tradeoff analysis feature in the Enhanced Taskmaster workflow to evaluate different implementation approaches and make informed decisions.

> **Note:** For a detailed technical breakdown of the workflow process, see [Tradeoff Analysis Workflow](./tradeoff-analysis-workflow.md).

## Overview

Tradeoff analysis is a structured approach to evaluating different implementation options for a task by analyzing benefits and drawbacks. The Taskmaster tradeoff analysis feature:

1. **Identifies Multiple Approaches**: Generates several potential implementation strategies
2. **Analyzes Pros and Cons**: Lists advantages and disadvantages of each approach
3. **Evaluates Key Metrics**: Rates each approach on complexity, risk, and time estimates
4. **Documents Decisions**: Records the selected approach and rationale for future reference
5. **Integrates MCP Servers**: Leverages AI assistance for more comprehensive analysis

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Run the tradeoff analysis in interactive mode:

```bash
npm run taskmaster:tradeoff
```

### Analyze a Specific Task

To perform tradeoff analysis for a specific task:

```bash
npm run taskmaster:tradeoff-task -- <task-id>
```

Or use the direct command:

```bash
node scripts/taskmaster-enhanced.js --tradeoff-task=<task-id>
```

### MCP Server Integration

Enable MCP server integration for AI-assisted tradeoff analysis:

```bash
npm run taskmaster:tradeoff-mcp
```

Or combine it with a specific task:

```bash
node scripts/taskmaster-enhanced.js --tradeoff-task=<task-id> --mcp-integrate
```

## The Tradeoff Analysis Process

When you run a tradeoff analysis, the workflow follows these steps:

1. **Task Information Gathering**: Retrieves task details and requirements
2. **Approach Generation**: Identifies potential implementation approaches
3. **Analysis**: Evaluates pros and cons for each approach
4. **Metric Calculation**: Rates complexity, risk, and time requirements
5. **Presentation**: Displays all approaches with their tradeoffs
6. **Selection**: User selects the preferred approach (or auto-selects in automated mode)
7. **Documentation**: Creates a detailed document recording the decision and rationale
8. **Optional Task Breakdown**: Can immediately break down the task based on the selected approach

## MCP Server Enhanced Analysis

When using MCP server integration, the analysis is enhanced by:

1. Connecting to the appropriate AI agent for the current development phase
2. Generating more detailed and comprehensive approaches
3. Providing deeper analysis of pros and cons
4. Adding code impact assessments
5. Suggesting testing strategies for each approach

The MCP server analyzes:

- Current codebase patterns and architecture
- Technology stack constraints and best practices
- Team skill levels and preferences
- Project requirements and non-functional attributes
- Long-term maintainability considerations

## Tradeoff Analysis Output

The analysis creates a detailed markdown document in `docs/taskmaster/decisions/` with:

- Task identification information
- Date of analysis
- Selected approach with description
- Implementation metrics (complexity, risk, time estimate)
- Decision rationale (if provided)
- Complete list of all approaches considered
- Detailed pros/cons for each approach
- Additional metrics (code impact, testing strategy) when using MCP

## Criteria for Evaluation

Approaches are evaluated based on these criteria:

| Criterion | Description | Scale |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Complexity | Technical complexity and cognitive load | 1-5 (lower is simpler) |
| Risk | Likelihood of problems or failures | 1-5 (lower is safer) |
| Time Estimate | Implementation time required | Hours (lower is faster) |

In automated mode, the system uses a weighted formula to select the best approach:

- Complexity: 30% weight
- Risk: 50% weight
- Time: 20% weight

## GitHub Actions Integration

The tradeoff analysis can be triggered through GitHub Actions:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select "Enhanced Taskmaster Workflow"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure the workflow:
   - Action: Select "tradeoff"
   - Task ID: Enter the task to analyze
   - Phase: Select the development phase
   - MCP Integration: Enable for AI assistance
5. Click "Run workflow" to start the process

The analysis output will be committed to the repository for team reference.

## Customizing Tradeoff Analysis

You can customize the analysis by:

1. Modifying the criteria weights in `findBestApproach()` function
2. Adding new evaluation criteria to the approach objects
3. Tailoring the MCP agent prompts for your specific domain
4. Creating custom templates for different types of tasks

## Best Practices

For effective tradeoff analysis:

1. **Run Early**: Perform analysis during the planning or design phase
2. **Involve Team**: Discuss the generated approaches with team members
3. **Document Rationale**: Always record why an approach was selected
4. **Review Periodically**: Check if the chosen approach is still valid as the project evolves
5. **Use MCP Integration**: Enable AI assistance for more thorough analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Basic Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify the task ID exists
2. Check that the required information is available for analysis
3. Try running without MCP integration as a fallback
4. For more detailed analysis, manually add task description and requirements

### Advanced Troubleshooting

For deeper issues:

1. Look for error messages in the console output
2. Check MCP server connectivity if using integration
3. Verify that the taskmaster workflow script has correct permissions
4. Make sure the required documentation directories exist
