# Simulated Gemini Response

This is a simulated response from the Gemini AI model. In actual execution, 
this would be generated content from Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

## Key Points
- This is simulated content only
- In real execution, detailed AI-generated analysis would appear here
- The autonomous mode is functioning correctly

For testing purposes, you can consider this a successful response that meets
the requirements of the prompt:

```
Task: Implement TypeScript event handlers (ID: 16645323)
Description: Add TypeScript interface for e...
```

When using with a real API key, genuine AI-generated content will be provided.
